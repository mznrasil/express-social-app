Role Based Authorization:
1. Three roles: admin, user, guest
2. Create a role column in User table that stores multiple roles of a user (must be enum[])
3. When registering a user, give the user "guest" role by default
4. Also, sign the token with user role as well
5. Create a middleware to check the role of the user
